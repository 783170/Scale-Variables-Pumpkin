# Scale-Variables-Pumpkin
A project I completed at the beginning of my senior year (2021-2022) of high school that focused on using a variable to scale images that we created with our code. I decided to base my scaling variable on the window size, so that my scene would always fill the entire window.

+ I created this project in the fall and decided to create a pumpkin with falling leaves and changing sky
+ The main goal of this project was getting more familiar with JavaScript as this was only my second project
+ I tried to mess around with a lot of geometry elements and loops to create different shapes
+ I also worked a lot with how I could use loops and multiple shapes to create a more 3D appearance
+ Something that I had a lot of fun with was having all my colors become slightly darker and slightly lighter as the sun and moon moved
+ To see the colors change more clearly click [here](https://editor.p5js.org/783170/sketches/O3fdjBUGg](https://editor.p5js.org/erinnicoledewitt/full/Ts6-F1zvn))
+ I am particularly proud of how I managed many different moving parts in one visual
